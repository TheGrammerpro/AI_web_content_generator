A shot at automating some elements of a website

This is a Python code that uses Flask and LLaMa3 to automate certain elements of website content.

The code uses three instances of LLaMa3 to generate, refine and format an article written on the basis of 20 of the most popular articles of a chosen topic.

The end result is an html formatted article ready to be displayed on the website.
